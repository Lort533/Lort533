### Welcome!
I'm pretty much a mid-level developer, learning every so often I code.<br>
<br>
Previously I used: **Python (basics), C# (basics with Unity), etc.**<br>
In my opinion I can code in (but didn't for a long time): **PHP.**<br>
Every so often I use: **JavaScript (browser-side only), Java.**<br>
Commonly I use: **Lua, C++.**
