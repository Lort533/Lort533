### Welcome!
I'm pretty much a mid-level developer.
I'm learning every so often I code.
Previously I used: Python (basics), C# (basics with Unity), etc.
In my opinion I can code in (but didn't for a long time): PHP.
Every so often I use: JavaScript (browser-side only), Java.
Commonly I use: Lua, C++.
