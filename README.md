### Welcome!
I'm pretty much a mid-level developer, learning every so often I code.<br>
<br>
Previously I used: **Python (PyQt5, basic Flask), Skript (it's a Minecraft plugin), Assembly (absolute basics), TypeScript (used commonly for like 2 months), etc.**<br>
Every so often I use: **JavaScript (front-end/extensions), Java (from Minecraft plugins to Android apps), C# (Unity/Windows Forms), PHP.**<br>
Commonly I use: **Lua, C++ (for a lot of stuff, some WinAPI, Qt some Arduino).**
